- Handle search parameters and filtering
- Implement proper TypeScript types
- Add Suspense boundaries
- SEO optimization

### Client-Side Functionality
- Vehicle type switching
- Dynamic filtering
- URL-based state management
- Grid/list view switching
- Loading states
- Error handling

### Data Structure
- Support multiple vehicle types
- Common and type-specific fields
- Efficient querying
- Type safety

### Technical Requirements
- TypeScript strict mode
- Next.js 13+ app router
- Firebase 9+
- Server Components
- Error boundaries
- Accessibility
- Performance optimization
